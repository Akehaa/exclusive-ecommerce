# Exclusive Store

## The design used is a free design from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and it was made by: [@mdrimel15](https://www.figma.com/@mdrimel15)

### The design is just for Desktop, so i had to do some adaptations for mobile.

## About the project

### This project uses:

[Next.JS 13 with the App route ](https://nextjs.org/docs);

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/);

[TailwindCSS with PostCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss);

[Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api);

[React-Slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/);

[Material UI](https://mui.com/);

[Radix-UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

### Some features such as colors, sizes, filters, login, etc., do not work due to lack of a proper back-end and DB.

Exclusive is a really complete e-commerce, with multiple pages(static and dynamic), sliders and products.

Also it's my first project using the new NextJS 13.
